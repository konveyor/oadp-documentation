## Why OADP?

One of the current problems observed in OCS enviroments is that current
workloads cannot be backed up. OADP provides the ability to backup applications
that covers cluster metadata and application persistent data. It does so by
using components such as:
- [Velero](https://velero.io/)
- [Restic](https://restic.net/)
- OpenShift Backup/Restore Plugins
- OCS Storage Plugins
